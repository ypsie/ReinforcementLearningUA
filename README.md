## ReinforcementLearningUA
# Capstone Project of the Coursera Specialization "Reinforcement Learning" from the University of Alberta

Topics being covered in the Specialization (following "Reinforcement Learning by Suton and Barto"):
  - MDP, Value Functions, Bellman Equations, Dynamic Programming, Monte-Carlo Estimation
  - On-policy Prediction, Control with Approximation, Policy Gradient
  - Temporal Difference and Monte Carlo Learning methods
  
After this challenging specialization I could gain a good understanding of RL methods, their differences and their implementation aspects.

The capstone project consisted of implementing the whole RL-cycle (Environment: States/Rewards, Agent: NeuralNetwork/AdamAlgorithm, Softmax Action selection and expected SARSA) to solve a simulated lunar landing mission with reinforcement learning.

This is the visualization of my soltution:
